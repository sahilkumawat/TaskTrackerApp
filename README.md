## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

**User Experience Design**: Ensuring the app is not only functional but also intuitive and engaging for users can be challenging. Balancing simplicity with comprehensive features requires careful design and numerous iterations.
**Data Persistence**: Implementing a reliable system for saving and retrieving user data without loss or corruption can be complex. Ensuring UserDefaults or a more robust database system like CoreData or CloudKit works seamlessly is crucial.
**Calendar Integration**: Syncing with the native calendar app and handling different time zones and calendar formats can present unexpected complications.
